**NOTE**

This repo is being deprecated in favour of splitting each integration/lovelace card into separate repos. The reason is mainly for easier maintenance and support for HACS. The content of this repo will however be left intact for a few weeks to support users who run an lder version of HomeAssistant.

Custom components for HomeAssistant. The name of each subfolder describes the component, and includes all files necessary to run and configure it in HA.
All UI cmponents are placed under lovelace-cards/.
