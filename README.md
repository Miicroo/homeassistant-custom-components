# homeassistant-strava
This is a Strava component for HomeAssistant. It uses stravalib to generate statistics as sensors.

## How to setup

### Setting up a Strava app
1. Log in to https://developers.strava.com/
2. Create a new application
3. Fill in the app details, these are my choices:
  1. Application Name: homeassistant
  2. Category: Visualizer
  3. Club: -
  4. Website: http://localhost
  5. Application Description: Connects homeassistant to strava
  6. Authorization Callback Domain: localhost
4. When your app is created, you will see a Client ID and a Client secret generated by Strava
5. Open a browser and use the following link to see a consent screen: https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=**<YOUR_APPS_CLIENT_ID>**&redirect_uri=localhost&response_type=code&scope=view_private,write 
6. After authorizing the app you will be redirected to: http://localhost/?state=&code=**<CODE>**&scope=view_private,write
7. Copy the code
8. Issue a POST request to: https://www.strava.com/oauth/token?client_id=**<YOUR_APPS_CLIENT_ID>**&client_secret=**<YOUR_APPS_CLIENT_SECRET>**&code=**<CODE>**
9. If everything went well, Strava will return your profile plus an access token

### Setting up HomeAssistant
1. In your homeassistant config directory, create a strava sensor file. The path should look like this: **my-ha-config-dir/custom_components/sensor/strava.py**
2. Copy the contents of strava.py in this gitrepo to your nwly create file in HA
3. Create a new sensor. monitored_conditions are optional, default is to show biggest_ride_distance:
~~~~
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: strava
    accesstoken: the_accesstoken_you_created_previously
    monitored_conditions:
      - biggest_ride_distance
      - biggest_climb_elevation_gain
      - recent_ride_totals
      - recent_run_totals
      - ytd_ride_totals
      - ytd_run_totals
      - all_ride_totals
      - all_run_totals
~~~~
4. Restart homeassistant

## TODO
* Use the built in unit system in HA
* Expose more sensors
* Set a configurable argument to be the state of the totals (instead of forcing distance)
